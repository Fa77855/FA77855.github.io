## Summer Internship 2019
Over the Summer I interned full time with Elite SPice in Jessup MD which is a whole sale spice company. I worked in the Sterilization department which is essentially in charge of making sure that all of the spices that came into the facility are properly sterilized. The Sterilization department was also respomsible for monitoring and running additional experiemnts which is where I came in as an intern.
