## Summer Internship 2019
Over the Summer I interned full time with Elite SPice in Jessup MD which is a whole sale spice company. I worked in the Sterilization department which is essentially in charge of making sure that all of the spices that came into the facility are properly sterilized. The Sterilization department was also respomsible for monitoring and running additional experiemnts which is where I came in as an intern. 

### Things I gained experience in:
Environmental Sampling
<br><br>
Stack Tests
<br><br>
Observational Handwashing Experiments  <br><br>
Air Pressure Surveys 
<br><br>
Illumination Surveys
<br><br>
Residue testing for PPO and ETO

### More about Environmental Sampling
My boss was intersted in investing into an Ozone generator for the company which would basically pumo Ozone through the facilties where the spices are processed. The reasoning for this was that Ozone is good at reducing microbial bacteria, so by having a constant flow of Ozone would reduce the bacteria counts. So I was in charge of environemtnal sampling an area within the facility in order to gain baseline data for the experiment. Due to confidentiality, I can't show pictures of my work. Below I attached pictures of the plates that I used to give a visual representation.
