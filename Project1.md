## GIS Experience
---
While obtaining my degree at UMBC I have taken serval GIS (Geographic Information Systems) courses from introductory to advanced. During these three semesters that I've taken GIS courses, I have become proficient in ARCmap, QGIS, and RStudio. 
<br> <br>
Below I have an example of a maps that I made using data that was provided about Baltimore in regards to vacant buildings and calls that reported rat sightings.
