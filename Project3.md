## Ecological Surveying 

While I was studying at Anne Arundel Community College I did a service learning project with my professor Dr. Bushmann which involved surveying horseshoe crab populations in the Chesapeake Bay. I worked with him in the Summer of 2017 and 2018. The field surveying consisted of sampling the population over the Summer at high tides during the early am when the horseshoe crabs would come onto shore to mate. In a small team we would walk up and down the beach and  record the number of horseshoe crabs observed along with specifying how many were male/female, taking pictures, and marking their location. In the Summer of 2018, we collected blood samples which is the image below of the vial with blue blood from the horseshoe crab.
