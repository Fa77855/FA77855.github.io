# Proposal for first Project 
---
**Topic**: Ideal Neighborhoods for children in Baltimore 
<br> <br>
**Data**: Shapefiles from Open Baltimore https://data.baltimorecity.gov/
<br> <br>
**Transformations/Subsets to data**: Pull parks from the Baltimore Land Use shapefile 
<br> <br>
**Analysis**: The analysis I am doing is gathering data from Baltimore (parks, pools, and public schools) in order to determine what neighborhoods are most ideal for children based off of walking distance 
<br> <br>
**Outputs**: I will be making a map with QGIS displaying what neighborhoods are most ideal for children
